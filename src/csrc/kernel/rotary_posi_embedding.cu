/*
	rotaryPosiEmbeddingBatched

	Perform rotary positional embedding on a batch of tokens.

	## Background

	Rotary positional embedding (RoPE), as proposed in "ROFORMER : ENHANCED
	TRANSFORMER WITH ROTARY POSITION EMBEDDING", is a method of positional
	embedding that encodes the absolute position while incorporates the
	relative position between tokens. Models like LLaMA and LLaMA2 are based
	on RoPE.

	## Introduction

	This kernel takes a bunch of tokens and their absolute positions with in the
	request, and performs RoPE on them.

	## Implementation Details

	We summon a grid of shape (num_tokens), i.e. each thread block is
	responsible for one token. Each thread block has head_dim/2 threads. The 
	i-th thread will deal with the (2i) and (2i+1) th elements in the head_dim
	in every head.

	## Notes

	In practice we perform RoPE on both the query and the key. Note that when
	performing RoPE on the key, we need to pass num_local_kv_heads as num_heads,
	while performing on the query we need to pass num_local_q_heads as num_heads.
